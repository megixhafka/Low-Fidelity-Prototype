# Low Fidelity Prototype Project
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, affecting many
industries, including the healthcare industry. The production, distribution, and delivery of
medicals and vaccines have become increasingly challenging due to the pandemic. This report
will focus on the problem subspace faced by a healthcare company that produces medicals and
vaccines, maintains the products, prepares packages, and delivers them to pharmacies and
hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.
#### In the Design Thinking Class, I have created a drone for delivery with cardboard as a low fidelity prototype.
